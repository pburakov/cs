Bloom Filter
============

A Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure that allows to test whether an element is a member of a set. False positive matches are possible, but false negatives are not â€“ in other words, a query returns either "possibly in set" or "definitely not in set".

The filter was conceived by Burton Howard Bloom in 1970.
