"""
A DP is an algorithmic technique which is usually based on a recurrent formula
 and one (or some) starting states. A sub-solution of the problem is constructed
 from previously found ones. DP solutions have a polynomial complexity which
 assures a much faster running time than other techniques like backtracking,
 brute-force etc.

Dynamic strategy is often similar to recursive solution that includes caching or
 other means of storing previously found solutions.

For examples, see dp.py in /exercies folder.
