"""
AVL tree (Adelson-Velsky-Landis tree) is a self-balancing binary search tree,
 which is balanced by height. It is an augmented BST that additionally keeps the
 height attribute of an individual node.

Besides regular BST properties, AVL tree keeps the heights of the two child subtrees
 of any node differ by at most one. Rebalancing is performed by one of more tree
 rotations on every update of a dynamic set. Balanced tree structure guarantees
 node lookup, insertion and deletion in O(log(n)) time.
