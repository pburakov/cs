This repository was created and used during my preparation for technical interviews as a 
 way to brush up and summarize my CS knowledge and problem-solving skills. Maybe it will be
 useful to someone else. That's why it's here. 
 
Have fun! 

## Description
The code is written in Python 3. [PyCharm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm) is a great
 tool to navigate this code. 
 
Modules are organized by subject and accompanied by lots of comments. I often use
 single-letter variables, because that is how they appear in the most academic descriptions
 such as CLRS ("Introduction to Algorithms" by Thomas Cormen at al).

## Disclaimer
This repository was created for personal use for the purpose of study. I do not 
 encourage production use of any of these code snippets.
