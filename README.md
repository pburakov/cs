This repository was created and used during my preparation for technical interviews as a 
 way to brush up and summarize my CS knowledge and problem-solving skills. Maybe it will be
 useful to someone else. That's why it's here. 
 
Have fun!

The code is written in Python 3. [PyCharm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm) is a great 
 tool to navigate this code. Modules are organized by subject and accompanied by lots of 
 comments. I often use single-letter variables, only because that is how they appear in the 
 most academic descriptions.
