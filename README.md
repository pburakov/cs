This repository was created and used during my preparation for technical interviews as a 
way to brush up and summarize my CS and problem-solving skills. Maybe it will be useful to 
someone else some day. That's why this repositary is here.
 
Have fun!

### Overview

The code is written in Python 3. Modules are organized by subject and accompanied by   
Sphinx-compatible documentation. I often use single-letter variables, only because this is 
how they appear in the most academic descriptions.
