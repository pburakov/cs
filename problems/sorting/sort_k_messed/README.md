# Sort K-messed Array

Given an array `A` of length `n` where each element is at most `k > 1` places away from
 its sorted position, plan and code an efficient algorithm to sort `A`.

Example: With `A=[3, 1, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6]` and `k=2` the element belonging to index 3 in the
 sorted array, may be at indices 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 on the given array.

Array should be sorted in place.
