# Longest Increasing Subsequence

Longest increasing sequence, or LIS, if a sequence of increasing, not necessarily
 continuous, elements of an input set in order of their appearance. Single element is LIS
 by definition.

Example: `A=[2, 4, 3, 5, 1, 7, 6, 9, 8, 6]`, `output=[2, 3, 5, 6, 8]`.

This algorithm is described in detail in the book "Algorithm Design Manual" by S. Skiena.
