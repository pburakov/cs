Mars Lander
===========

Imagine you are sending a lander to Mars. Your lander has :math:`p` probes on-board that
can travel the shortest route at constant speed to designated points of interest for a
scientific survey and then back following the same path. You are given a map of surface
sized :math:`mÃ—n`. Map tiles are encoded. ``X`` are rocky tiles which are impassable and
``-`` are normal tiles.

You are given set of coordinates :math:`P` of your point of interest, :math:`(x, y) \in P
: |P| = p`, one survey point per probe. Your probes can move to adjacent horizontal and
vertical tile, consuming exactly :math:`1` unit of fuel on every move.

Find such a landing position for your lander so that the fuel consumption for all *p*
probes is minimal. Assume that all points are reachable (not blocked by rocks).

Example::

    P=[(0, 0), (0, 3), (3, 1)]

    M = [
        ['-', 'X', 'X', '-'],
        ['-', '-', 'X', '-'],
        ['-', '-', '-', '-'],
        ['-', '-', '-', '-'],
    ]

    solve(M, P) -> (2, 1)

I was given this problem when I was interviewing at Google. Below is my stab at it.

    The idea is to measure distances by building distance maps (fuel cost) for each survey
    point in relation to every potential landing location. Best candidate for landing
    would be the cell with a minimal sum of those distances.

    Algorithm assumes that all survey points are reachable and no region is completely
    blocked by rocks.

        :math:`O(p(mn-x)+mn)` where :math:`p` is number of probes, :math:`mn` is the total
