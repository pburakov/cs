# Lowest Common Ancestor of Two Nodes

Find the lowest common ancestor (LCS) of two nodes in a binary tree (not necessarily 
 a BST).

Example:
```
     a
    / \
   b   c
  / \
 d   e 
LCA('e', 'd') -> 'b'
LCA('d', 'c') -> 'a'
```

You are given a pointer to a root of a tree two pointers to the target nodes. Your 
 algorithm should not use parent pointers.
