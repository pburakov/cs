# N Queens

N-queens is the problem of placing `n` chess queens on an `n`Ã—`n` chessboard so that no
 two queens threaten each other. Thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the
 same row, column, or diagonal.

There are no solutions for `n` less than 4. Interestingly, the 6-queens puzzle has fewer
 solutions than the 5-queens puzzle. There are 22,317,699,616,364,044 solutions for
 `n=26`.

    Solves N-queens problem for n-sized board.

    There are various ways to solve this problem. This solution uses combinatorial search
     of all possible permutations of a one-dimensional array of unique integers, with an
     addition of pruning a recursive branch when has an invalid state.

    Since queens cannot share same row or column, one of the dimensions can be taken out
     of the problem completely. Each generated permutation is checked for validity of a
     solution. Complete 2-dimensional board can be easily reconstructed once the
     solution is found.

    Complexity: There is currently no known formula for the exact number of solutions,
     or even for its asymptotic behaviour.
