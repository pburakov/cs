# N Queens

N-queens is the problem of placing `n` chess queens on an `n`Ã—`n` chessboard so that no
 two queens threaten each other. Thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the
 same row, column, or diagonal.

There are no solutions for `n` less than 4. Interestingly, the 6-queens puzzle has fewer
 solutions than the 5-queens puzzle. There are 22,317,699,616,364,044 solutions for
 `n=26`.
