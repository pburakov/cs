# Three Sum

Find integer triplets in an array with the sum of 0.

Example:
```
 Input: [1, -6, 3, 8, -2, 2] -> sort -> [-6, -2, 1, 2, 3, 8]
 Output: (-6, -2, 8)
```
This might seem like a trivial problem, yet it can be regarded as a decently good
 approach to iterating the array using three pointers in quadratic time.
