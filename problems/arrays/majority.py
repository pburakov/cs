"""
Majority Element
================

In an array of comparable objects (e.g. integers), find the majority element. If :math:`n`
is the size of the array, majority element is an element that occurs at least :math:`|n/_2|`
times in the array. Return ``null`` if no majority element is present.

Example::

    Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 2]
    Output: 2
    Input: [5, 2, 1, 4, 2]
    Output: None

The algorithm should use constant space.

def solution(A):
    """Finds majority element in the list.

    This solution implements Mooreâ€™s Voting Algorithm which is a two step process. First we
    get an element occurring most of the time in the array. By counting we evaluate if our
    candidate is supported by more occurring elements. We reset the counter if it went
    below zero.

    Statistically, the first step may give us a false positive. On the second step we check
    if the element obtained from above step is in fact a majority element.

    Complexity:
        :math:`O(n)`, no extra space is used.

    :param list[object] A: Input list.
    :return: Majority element or :data:`None` if not found.
