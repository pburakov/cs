# Cycle in a Linked List

This another version of infamous "detect cycle in a list" problem. 
Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return `null`.

Example :

```
Input:
          __________
         |          |
         \/         |
a -> b -> c -> d -> e

Output: pointer to 'c'.
```

Your solution should use constant space.
