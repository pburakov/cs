# Majority Element

In an array of comparable objects (e.g. integers), find the majority element. If *n* is the size of the array, majority element is an element that occurs at least *|n/2|* times in the array. Return `null` if no majority element is present.

Example:
```
Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 2]
Output: 2
Input: [5, 2, 1, 4, 2]
Output: None
```

The algorithm should use constant space.
