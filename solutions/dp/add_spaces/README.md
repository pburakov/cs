# Add Spaces

Imagine that a malicious virus has erased all whitespace characters in your text files.
 Given a dictionary of words, you want to recreate valuable information with as less
 unmatched words as possible. All inputs are lowercase, punctuation is ignored.

```
D = {"this", "is", "favorite", "food"}
string = "thisismikesfavoritefood"
Output: "this is mikes favorite food" 
(5 unmatched characters in word "mikes")
```
This problem is described in detail in Gayle McDowell's book "Cracking the Coding
 Interview".
