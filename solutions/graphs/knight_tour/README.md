# Knight Tour

Knight tour is a famous mathematical puzzle often given to CS students.

Given a chessboard of size `n` x `n` and a starting coordinates, find a sequence of moves
 of a knight, such that the knight visits every square only once.

Proposed solution to a Knight Tour problem is an interesting intersection of a
 combinatorial search problem and a graph path search algorithm.
